## Abuse Reportr

Abuse Reportr is an attempt to automate the following within [Nextbridge](http://nextbridge.pk)

 - Automatic Population of new resources from DMZ (Nextbridge Firewall)
 - Automatic Population of Employee record (from NextHRM API)
 - One-click abuse report to relevant Line Managers
 - Email Templates for common scenarios (torrent, internet abuse etc)
 - Mapping different IPs to employees

### Current Solution

I want to effectively remove/replace the [current solution](https://dmz.nextbridge.org/knowabuse.php) which is flawless but offers no flexibility

### Warning! There is no documentation at the moment so use at your OWN RISK
